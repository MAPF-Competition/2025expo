Hello Robot Runners!

We invite all teams and team members from the League of Robot Runners to participate in our 2024 Virtual Expo, which takes place online May 20th, from 1530 EST (UTC-5).

The expo is a community event where we celebrate and reflect on the recent competition round. It is an opportunity for participants to share their experiences and insights into the challenge problems, to tell the community about their innovative approaches, and to celebrate the performances that helped make the inaugural League of Robot Runners such a memorable success!

To participate in the program teams and team members will submit a technical report on a relevant topic, as described in the Topics of Interest. Following a light review, selected works will be presented to the community, in the form of a technical talk. Written reports, and video recordings of the talks, will be made available for download during and after the expo.

**Program Highlights:**

The technical program will feature a number of sessions which will be of interest to competition participants and interested members of the broader community:



* Industry Keynote from Amazon Robotics.
* Awards Ceremony, to celebrate distinguished and noteworthy performances.
* Technical talks from competing teams and team members.
* Community meeting, to discuss the future direction of the competition.

**Topics of Interest:**

We invite submissions related to any aspect of the League of Robot Runners. This includes but is not limited to: 



* Description of systems (algorithms, implementations) used in the competition.
* Post-competition data-analysis, including tools and methodologies.
* Position papers, reflecting on the competition setup, goals or any other related issues that will be of interest to the community.

     


Submissions are non-archival. They can describe recently published work or work that is under submission elsewhere, or encouraging preliminary results from works in progress.

**Submissions:**

Submissions take the form of a technical report describing a topic of interest and must be in AAAI style (see instructions in the [Author Kit](https://aaai.org/aaai-conference/submission-instructions/)).  The submission type can be any of the following: 2-page extended abstract or 4-page short paper or 8-page long paper, plus 1 additional page for references.  Certain types of submissions are better suited for certain types of topics; for example, authors of system descriptions may wish to aim for a longer paper, as this helps future replication and extension studies. Each submission will undergo a light review process, single-blind, to ensure an acceptable quality. Submissions must be timely and are made via EasyChair at [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lorr2024](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lorr2024). 

**Important Dates:**



* Submission deadline: 14th April 2024
* Paper notification: 1st May April 2024
* Final version: 10th May 2024

All deadlines are “anywhere on earth” (UTC-12). 

For any questions about this call, please reach out via email to the following address: [organisers@leagueofrobotrunners.org](mailto:organisers@leagueofrobotrunners.org).

We look forward to your submissions!
